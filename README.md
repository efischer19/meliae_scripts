# meliae_scripts
A collection of scripts for interacting with meliae dumps. Very simple. Use at your own risk, feel free to copy or change things as needed.

Shoutout to Adam for his help with the Neo4j script

Most are intended to be used in bash, with output piped to a new file like this:

`./type_size_diff.py lms_dump/large_type_sizes.out lms_dump/small_type_sizes.out > lms_dump/type_size_diff.out`
